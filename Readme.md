This project will be used as reference example of Custom Expenses Application done via CIT standards.
Previously, when we built Linklaters training, we did a project named as "Custom Expenses" for them using SAP standards.
SAP standards includes the use of Routing mechanism, Component.js, neo-app.json etc. files whereas, at CIT, in past we are developing applications using CITApp.js and CIT standards.
This project demonstrate the usage of CITApp.js and related JS files.

Note: This is not an running application, just "Web Content" folder from a running Eclipse application.
